        <p>Gypsy Swing Revue is a group based in the Denver metro area of
          Colorado. They perform music in the "Hot Club" style popularized
          by Django Reinhardt and Stephane Grappelli in Paris during the 30's
          and 40's. The focus is on tight arrangements with plenty of room for
          jazz improvisation. With a mix of instrumental pieces and vocals,
          this energetic music is fun for everyone.
