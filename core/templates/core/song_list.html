      <p>Django Reinhardt and Stephane Grappelli were working musicians
        in Paris in the mid 1930's. They were working as side men in Louis
        Vola's band, but between sets, they would jam on the new swing music
        coming over from America. Eventually settling on a format of two
        rhythm guitars, lead guitar, violin and upright bass, they created
        their own versions of the music that was becoming popular in the
        States, but had yet to make inroads in France and Europe in general.
